# YAP
(you-map)

### A simple mapping application that adds the current viewer to the map.

* Uses [GEOCODER](#http://www.rubygeocoder.com/) for reverse IP lookups.

* Uses [Google Maps API v3](#https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) for mapping servies

* Goal is to have a blank page covered in colorful dots, that will eventually fill in the map.
